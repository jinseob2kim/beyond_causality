  Modern causal inference in epidemiology relies on estimating average treatment
  effects (ATE) under assumptions of well-defined interventions and positivity.
  In real-world data (RWD), these assumptions frequently fail due to clinical
  guidelines, contraindications, and structural constraints. We propose the
  Epidynamix framework, which reinterprets causal effects not as forces acting
  on outcomes, but as directional movements within a risk potential field.
  Under this view, positivity violations are not estimation failures but
  structural boundaries revealing the geometry of clinical practice. The ATE
  becomes a first-order approximation of a richer landscape, valid only when
  effect heterogeneity is negligible. Through simulation, we demonstrate how
  traditional methods (Cox, IPTW) collapse structure into scalar summaries,
  while the field-based approach preserves clinically meaningful variation.
  This framework offers a complementary lens for RWD analysis where the
  standard causal question may be structurally unanswerable.

## Introduction

Causal inference in epidemiology typically asks: *What is the average effect of
treatment A on outcome Y?* This question is formalized through potential outcomes
$Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$, with the Average Treatment Effect defined as:

$$
\text{ATE} = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]
$$

This framework has been remarkably successful in randomized trials. However, in
real-world data (RWD), the system is high-dimensional, time-varying, and
constrained by clinical guidelines. We increasingly encounter situations where:

- Treatment is mandated for high-risk patients (positivity violation)
- The "same" intervention varies by context, timing, and patient state
- Treatment decisions are entangled with prognosis (confounding by indication)

When positivity fails, standard approaches—trimming extreme propensity scores,
restricting to overlap regions—treat this as an estimation problem to be fixed.
We propose an alternative interpretation: **positivity violation is not a bug;
it is a feature that reveals the structure of clinical practice.**


## The Epidynamix Framework

### From Force to Field

Drawing an analogy from physics: Newton modeled gravity as a force acting between
objects. Einstein reinterpreted gravity not as a force, but as curvature of
spacetime—objects follow geodesics in a curved manifold.

We propose a similar shift for epidemiology. Instead of modeling treatment as a
"force" that causes outcomes:

$$
A \longrightarrow Y
$$

we view treatment as **regime selection**—choosing which potential surface to evaluate:

$$
\mathcal{I}_a: x \mapsto \Phi_a(x)
$$

where $\Phi_a(x) = -\log \lambda(x,a)$ is the **risk potential** under regime $a$. Higher $\Phi_a$ means lower instantaneous hazard, i.e., relative safety.


### ATE as First-Order Approximation

Let $\Phi_a(x)$ denote the risk potential under regime $a\in\{0,1\}$. The effect surface is the finite difference:

$$
\Delta_A \Phi(x) = \Phi_1(x) - \Phi_0(x).
$$

The ATE is the average of this local contrast:

$$
\text{ATE} = \mathbb{E}_X[\Delta_A \Phi(X)].
$$

This average is **information-preserving** only when $\text{Var}_X[\Delta_A \Phi] \approx 0$
(homogeneous effects). When effects vary across patient states, the ATE collapses
a rich distribution into a single number.


### Identification and Positivity

Standard positivity requires $0 < P(A=1 \mid X=x) < 1$ for all $x$. When this
fails—say, when clinical guidelines mandate treatment above a threshold—we face
a region where the counterfactual $Y(0)$ does not exist.

We do not avoid counterfactual reasoning; we avoid unnecessary notation. Estimation of $\Phi_a(x)$ and $\Delta_A\Phi(x)$ relies on exchangeability and positivity on the target domain. When $P(A=a\mid X=x)=0$, $\Phi_a(x)$ is undefined. In the field framework, such regions are **structural boundaries**: "cliffs" in the landscape where comparison is not possible. We map these boundaries rather than extrapolate across them.

### Notation and Time Treatment

We model the state as $S_t=X_t\in\mathcal{S}$ and index regimes by $a$. Hazards are time-varying, so we either (i) define landmark fields $\Phi_a(x;t^*)$ at a chosen $t^*$, (ii) construct discrete-time fields $\Phi_{a,t}(x)$, or (iii) use cumulative potentials over $[0,\tau]$.


## Illustrative Simulation

We simulated a 2D state space with:

- $X_1$: Systolic blood pressure (100–200 mmHg)
- $X_2$: Inflammatory marker (0–10 mg/L)
- $A$: Antihypertensive treatment (binary)
- Structural constraint: If $X_1 > 160$, then $A = 1$ (mandatory per guideline)

Treatment benefit was designed to increase with $X_1$ (heterogeneous effect).

**Results (N = 3,000):**

| Method | Output | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Cox HR | 0.55 | "Treatment reduces hazard by 45%" |
| IPTW ATE | 0.20 | "Treatment increases 1-year survival by 20%p" |
| Field $\Delta_A \Phi$ | 0.42 – 1.66 | Effect varies 4-fold across state space |

Traditional methods produce single numbers. The field approach reveals that
treatment benefit is **4-fold larger** for high-BP patients—precisely those
for whom the guideline mandates treatment. The gray "no-comparison zone"
($X_1 > 160$) is not a failure; it reflects clinical logic.

## Relation to Existing Approaches

### How is this different from CATE?

Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation—via causal forests,
meta-learners, or Bayesian methods—also addresses heterogeneity. The difference
is in the **question asked**:

| Aspect | CATE | Epidynamix |
|--------|------|------------|
| Question | "What is the effect for subgroup X=x?" | "What is the structure of the risk field?" |
| Positivity | Estimation problem | Information (boundary mapping) |
| Counterfactuals | Required | Optional notation; assumptions still required |
| Output | $\tau(x)$ (conditional effect) | $\Phi_a(x)$, $\Delta_A\Phi(x)$, boundaries |

CATE asks "what is the effect?"—conditional on covariates. Epidynamix asks
"what does the landscape look like, and where can we not go?"


### Novelty Claim

We do not claim to invent new mathematics. Potential landscapes exist in physics
and systems biology (e.g., Waddington's epigenetic landscape). Our contribution
is applying this lens to **clinical RWD**, where positivity violations are common,
effects are entangled with state, and the average-effect question may be
structurally unanswerable.

This is a **reinterpretation**, not an invention—a new language for an old problem.


## Discussion

The Epidynamix framework offers a complementary perspective to standard causal
inference. It does not replace existing methods; rather, it clarifies their
domain of validity.

**When ATE works:** If the risk field is smooth, low-curvature, and well-connected
(positivity holds everywhere), the ATE is an accurate summary. Traditional methods
excel here.

**When ATE fails:** If effects are highly heterogeneous, or if structural constraints
create disconnected regions, the ATE may be misleading or undefined. The field
approach provides richer output—a map rather than a number.

**Practical implications:**

1. Report effect heterogeneity alongside average effects
2. Visualize the treatment effect landscape when possible
3. Treat positivity violations as findings, not errors
4. Consider whether the causal question is answerable before estimating

**Limitations:** The framework is conceptual; practical estimation of $\Phi_a(x)$
requires flexible models (e.g., GAMs, neural networks) and careful validation.
Extension to time-varying treatments and high-dimensional states remains an
open challenge.


## Conclusion

Newtonian mechanics is not wrong—it is flat-space physics. Causal inference
is not false—it is a low-curvature approximation.

Real-world epidemiology, with its structural constraints and heterogeneous
effects, may require a geometric view. The Epidynamix framework offers one
such lens: treating causal effects not as forces, but as directional movements
within a structured risk field.

When the standard causal question cannot be answered, perhaps we should ask
a different question.
