### Figure 2. Positivity violation: failure vs structural boundary

(A) Causal inference interpretation
-----------------------------------

Propensity score
1.0 |███████████
    |
    |
0.0 +-----------------------------> X

→ Extreme weights
→ Trimming
→ Estimand changes
→ "Analysis failure"


(B) Field-based interpretation
-------------------------------

Risk Φ(s)
High |          █████████
     |          █████████   ← forbidden / unreachable region
     |          █████████
Low  |__________█████████________________ State space

→ Positivity violation = structural cliff
→ System-imposed constraint
→ Object of study, not a nuisance

> Figure 2. Interpretation of positivity violation. While causal inference treats lack of overlap as a methodological failure requiring trimming or restriction, the field-based perspective interprets it as a structural boundary imposed by the healthcare system.
