(A) Causal inference
--------------------

Question:
"What is the average effect of A?"

→ Collapse structure into a single scalar:
   ATE = +0.23 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.56)


(B) Field-based analysis
------------------------

Question:
"Where does risk concentrate and how do states move?"

→ Output:
- Risk gradients
- Transition bottlenecks
- High-curvature regions
- Irreversible paths

→ Produces a map, not a number


> Figure 3. Different outputs from the same RWD under causal and field-based frameworks. Causal inference collapses complex structure into a scalar estimand, whereas the field-based approach yields a landscape describing risk gradients and transition constraints.
